# 3BLD_parser

## the program get a raw reconstruction (only moves) and output a reconstruction of the comms you used
## the programm can help if:

#### you reconstruct a bld solve but dont want to follow and write the comms but only to trace the actual moves
	
#### you have a smart cube and you want to auto reconstruct the solution to bld

#### you look at a reconstruction and the comms are written in [A , B] format' and you want to see the final alg (basicilly after all the cancellations)
